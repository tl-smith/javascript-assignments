# Drum Kit Project

The Drum Kit project is a fun and interactive way to learn the basics of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS transitions. This project will allow users to play musical notes using the computer's keyboard, and as each key is pressed, the corresponding sound will play with a visual indication.

## Objectives:
By the end of this project, you will:

- Understand JavaScript Basics, including variables, constants, and functions.

- Learn how to handle keyboard events and respond to keydown events.

- Work with the DOM (Document Object Model) to select and manipulate elements.

- Explore CSS Transitions and how JavaScript can trigger smooth animations.

- Build an interactive drum kit using the keyboard to play sounds.

## Key Features:

- Keyboard Control: Play drums using your keyboard by pressing specific keys.

- Visual Feedback: Each key will visually respond to a keypress, indicating the note played.

- Audio Feedback: Sounds will play when the respective keys are clicked or pressed.

- CSS Animations: Smooth animations using CSS to visually highlight the key that was pressed.

## Expected Outcome:

You will create a musical instrument that can be played using the computerâ€™s keyboard. Each key on the keyboard will trigger a corresponding drum sound, and there will be a visual cue (like a "pressed" effect) to show which note is being played.
